        My name is <strong>Jeff</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have created this website to have a go my first personal project. I
        will be showcasing my past works and a couple more things just to
        practice React.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's gonna look pretty rough for a start, but it'll get better! I'll be
        working on this page from time to time so feel free to check in every
        now and then to see my progress!
      </p>
      <p>That's enough talk for now..</p>
